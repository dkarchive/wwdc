> app analytics is no longer in beta

- analytics provides answers
- reveals missed opportunities
- helps you a better app

- analytics data: acquisition to engagement
  - app store: app store views
  - sales: units, sales, in-app purchases
  - usage: installations (can be more than unit sales), sessions (engagement), active devices, active last 30 days
  
- how to get started: nothing to do, no code.. built into the os

- app store, ios 8 and above

- privacy is built in, it is opt in - if user checks `share with app developers`

- data avail in aggregate form, not identifiable

- itunes connect: app analytics (demo)
  - app list
  - app overview (usage is opt in only..)
  
- metrics: measures / dimensions
  - new measures: crashes - improve stability of your app
  - paying users
