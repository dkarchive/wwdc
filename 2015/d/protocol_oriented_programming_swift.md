# crusty

> old school enginner

- classes are awesome, address complexity of programming

- types are awesome, can do oop with structs and enums

## 3 beefs with classes

1. implicit sharing
2. inheritance all up in your business
3. lost type relationships

*code smell*

as! ASubClass

a sign that a type relationship is lost

we need a better abstractoin mechanism

> PROTOCOLS

swift is a protocol-orientated programming language

# start with a protocol

2 worlds of protocol

without self, with self
heterogenous/homogeneous
dynamic / static
